1. Alex Jin / 09/23/18:

2. Java version used, if not the official version for the class:

build 10.0.1+10

3. Precise command-line compilation examples / instructions:

> javac JokeServer.java <--- holds my worker/handler classes for Server & Admin
> javac JokeClient.java
> javac JokeClientAdmin.java
> javac UserState.java <--- this is the class that holds my boolean values for seen/unseen and processes indexes.


4. Precise examples / instructions to run this program:

In separate shell windows:

> java JokeServer
> java JokeClient
> java JokeClientAdmin

All acceptable commands are displayed on the various consoles.

Was not able to test across multiple machines, however I did not hardcode a serverName into any main files, so it should run by replacing localhost as expected:

> java JokeClient 140.192.1.22
> java JokeClientAdmin 140.192.1.22

5. List of files needed for running the program.

 a. checklist.html
 b. JokeServer.java
 c. JokeClient.java
 d. JokeClientAdmin.java
 e. UserState.java

5. Notes:

My Admin class does one thing: switch modes or quit.
For some reason, other FileWriter's were giving me trouble, but the output of Bytes worked just fine.
The only annoyance was having to figure out how to use line.separator to append to new line in .txt file.
Works as expected in concert with the AdminLooper and Handler. The handler lets you know which mode you're currently on.
Handler then Admin then passes the selection to handler which deals with the changeMode() method on the server.
